Expense Sharing System — Google Pay Inspired


 Project Overview
 This project is a Google Pay–inspired Expense Sharing System developed using Python and data
 science techniques. It helps a group of friends track shared expenses during a trip and fairly split the
 total spending.

 
 Real-Life Use Case
 Me and my friends went on a trip and everyone spent money at different times—for train tickets, hotel,
 food, etc. This system automatically calculates who owes whom and how much.
 Methodology

 
 1. Data Structure
 Each friend has a balance:- Positive: They get money back- Negative: They owe money
 
 2. Equal Contribution Method
 Expenses are split equally among participants of that expense.
 
 3. Settlement Algorithm
 People who owe (debtors) are matched with those who should receive (creditors) until balances reach
 zero.
 Key Features- Supports any number of friends- Handles uneven contributions- Prevents human calculation errors- Provides clean settlement instructions

 
 Conclusion

 
This system ensures transparency, fairness, and automatic settlement similar to Google Pay Split
 Expense.
