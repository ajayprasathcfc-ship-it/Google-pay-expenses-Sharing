# Google-pay-expenses-Sharing
This project is an expense sharing system inspired by Google Pay’s “Split Expense” feature. It helps friends track shared trip expenses, records who paid, splits each cost equally among participants, and calculates the final settlements, ensuring fairness, accuracy, and transparency for all.
